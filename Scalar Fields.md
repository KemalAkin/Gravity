# Scalar Fields

In order to obtain viable dark energy models, we require that the energy density of the scalar field remains
subdominant during the radiation and matter dominating eras, emerging only at late times to give rise to the
current observed acceleration of the universe. [1]

Of particular importance in the investigation of cosmological scenarios are those solutions in which the energy
density of the scalar field mimics the background fluid energy density. Cosmological solutions which satisfy
this condition are called **scaling solutions**. [1]
